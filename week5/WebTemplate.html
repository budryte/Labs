      <h2>This is the home page</h2>
      <p>In this week’s lecture we looked at how we can use CSS to change the layout of a website.
We talked about the box model and how you can use this to change the layout of items
on a page and also how we can float elements on a page in order to change where they
are positioned. The purpose of this activity is to give you another opportunity to put this
into practice and try to make a web page yourself.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="right">
      <div class="contentBox">
      <h3>Side section</h3>
      <p>Once completing the above you should have a go at recreating one of the pages on the
BBC news website. Work on creating the HTML and CSS for this and think about how the
content is laid out. Started code for this is provided through the following links</p>
